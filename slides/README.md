# Build with AI. Remember with evidence.

Kennesaw State University Claude event; approximately 90 minutes.
Presenters: Drew Schillinger and Tyler Sztuka.

The 63-slide deck follows a proposed prior-art check, a feature that searches shared memory for what other teams already decided or built,
through OODA, specification, implementation boundaries, a trust and works-cited
block, adversarial review, repair, and retained evidence. Slides 31–36, 39, 42, 45–47, 49, 51, and 62
were ported from the GSU deck, and slides 29, 30, 38, 43, 44, and 52 were adapted from the
Nightshift talk deck, and slides 53–58 cover Nightshift 0.4.0, including a walkthrough of one real run; INSTRUCTOR.md marks which are core and which are optional for the
90-minute talk. It includes speaker notes and a synthetic local
interactive fixture. The fixture is not a live Pensieve client.

## Present

Use Node 24.13.1. Install with `npm ci`, then run `npm run dev`.
Scripts are defined in package.json:6. Open the printed local URL; presenter
mode is available through Slidev's presentation controls.

Build with `npm run build`; export with `npm run export`.
Output: dist/ and ksu-pensieve.pdf (package.json:7).
If Chromium is unavailable, pass the installed Chrome executable through the
Slidev export executable-path option. See https://sli.dev/guide/exporting.

GitHub Pages deployment is configured in ../.github/workflows/pages.yml.
Public repository: https://github.com/doctor-ew/ksu-pensieve-workshop
Presentation: https://doctor-ew.github.io/ksu-pensieve-workshop/
For a project site, build with `npm run build -- --base /ksu-pensieve-workshop/`.
The instructor guide stays outside public/. Handouts and source excerpts are
bundled in public/ so their links work in the static build.

## Scope

- GSU code-photo background, font, portraits, and layout foundations reused.
- KSU marks supplied by Drew; no GSU logo or Hack-Her-Thon branding in the deck.
- The Claude logo is retained for the Claude event.
- No old API-credit promise, event date, or presenter split has been assumed.
- Definitions and inspected implementation have source footers; SOURCES.md
  distinguishes AWS source from the older Railway review.

See INSTRUCTOR.md for the proposed timing and rehearsal needs, ASSETS.md for
asset provenance, and VALIDATION.md for checks actually run.
