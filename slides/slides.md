<!--
Told as the presenter's own experience, not data: engineering teams across the world, a large number of Confluence pages, teams duplicating modules and solutions, and several coding agents run at once, some in worktrees of the same repository. Each new agent behaves like Mr. Meeseeks or the lead in Memento: it has a task, no memory of what came before, and builds its own answer. Do not name teams, people, or pages, and do not give a number for how much work is duplicated; none was measured. The point to land: saving something is not the same as the next agent finding and using it. That leads into the next slides and the feature we build.

Spend about three minutes. Staging spans multiple transactions; the final commit marker controls application visibility. The arrow from commit to exact-ID read means eligible, still subject to read authorization. Stream events or hourly reconciliation invoke the worker. A vector upsert can succeed before the progress receipt commits, so retry may repeat embedding. Search checks membership, committed records, and matching revisions; it does not require an indexing receipt. A vector may be searchable before progress is recorded.

<!--
A real, partially completed run, separate from the duration-formatter rehearsal. We asked Nightshift to improve Nightshift's dashboard. Product, Adversarial and Implementation passed. First Review failed because an existing continuation control was hidden inside a closed disclosure. Implementation repaired accessibility and ambiguous receipt labels; independent re-review and Drift passed. QA's automated checks passed, but the QA stage failed on required human visual case C-6. The controller incorrectly routed that human-only finding back to Implementation, and the persisted 3,600 active-second allowance exhausted before that worker could do substantive work. The original run did not fabricate acceptance, reset its budget or complete automatic publication. The operator then explicitly instructed merge after seeing the preview and the run limitations; PR 140 records operator-directed delivery and the failed receipts remain unchanged. Issue 139 records the sequencing defect and remains open. Do not describe all six stages or final proof as passed. A source merge is distinct from a stable release.

The supervised and autonomous plan paths are explicit in the implementation command; production deployment and permanent deletion require operator confirmation. Do not claim prompt text alone enforces a security boundary. For the students: an AI session that says it is allowed to do something has not made it allowed.

# What Nightshift 0.4.0<br>changes.

<div class="four"><section><h3>Control room</h3><p>Task-first dashboard with six selectable stages and retained attempt history.</p></section><section><h3>No default ceilings</h3><p>Explicit operator limits and retained usage remain enforceable.</p></section><section><h3>Manual acceptance</h3><p>Bound to recorded operator authority, not to a model’s say-so.</p></section><section><h3>Pinned runtime</h3><p>Nested helpers use the selected runtime. Resume inspection checks the evidence.</p></section></div>
<div class="takeaway">The default allowance that stopped the run on slide 43 is gone.</div>
<p>Known limitation: the human-acceptance repair loop (issue 139) remains open.</p>

<div class="source"><a href="https://github.com/doctor-ew/nightshift-community/blob/v0.4.0/docs/releases/0.4.0.md">Nightshift v0.4.0 release notes</a> · <a href="https://github.com/doctor-ew/nightshift-community/blob/v0.4.0/docs/154/IMPLEMENTATION.md">docs/154/IMPLEMENTATION.md</a> · adapted from Nightshift release notes · <PublicLink path="sources/SOURCES.md">Sources</PublicLink></div>

<!--
Release 0.4.0 of the presenter's own open-source harness; one example of the pattern. Everything on this slide comes from the release notes and the issue 154 implementation record. The 3,600 active-second allowance that ended the slide 43 run was a default of that historical run; per the release notes new work has no default work, call or repair ceiling, and explicit operator limits and retained usage remain enforceable. That is a policy change, not evidence that unlimited work is better: ask students what limit they would set. Manual acceptance now needs task-bound, recorded operator authority, which is the repair for the case where the harness had accepted a human-only check. Issue 139, the human-acceptance code-repair loop, is still listed as a known limitation. The release notes name the evidence: pull requests 132, 136, 137 and 140, and issues 138 and 139. Do not claim this release makes agent runs reliable on arbitrary projects.

# Walkthrough 1 ·<br>Prepare the project.

<!--
Step 1 of 4. Start from a small git repository with a passing test suite; this throwaway one had a single smoke test. Without this init step the factory command stops with MANIFEST_MISSING, which is what happened on the first attempt. Init reported status ready and committed the project manifest, routing file and the brief as one baseline commit. The brief is the input: a few acceptance cases in plain language, abridged here from the real TASK.md. NS is the path to a Nightshift 0.4.0 checkout. Optional mex graph indexing reported itself unavailable during init and did not block it.

# Walkthrough 2 ·<br>Run it.

<div class="terminal"><div class="terminal-label">TERMINAL · PER BRIEF OR TICKET</div><pre>bash "$NS/scripts/nightshift-factory.sh" \
  TASK.md --project "$PWD" \
  --provider claude --model sonnet \
  --provider-policy claude-only \

<p>Use a brief file or an issue URL. Nothing is pushed unless you add --push.</p>
<div class="takeaway">claude-only keeps specialist calls on Claude, too.</div>

<div class="source"><a href="https://github.com/doctor-ew/nightshift-community/blob/v0.4.0/scripts/nightshift-factory.sh">Nightshift v0.4.0 · scripts/nightshift-factory.sh</a> · options --project, --provider, --provider-policy, --model, --auth, --push · <PublicLink path="sources/SOURCES.md">Sources</PublicLink></div>

<!--
Step 2 of 4. The same command takes a ticket URL in place of the brief file. This run also passed --dashboard off, --dashboard-browser off and --base main so it would not open a browser or look for a remote; those are optional. The log confirmed claude-only policy and that paid API mode was disabled with no automatic billing fallback. The run took several minutes with only a working message on screen, so tell students to expect a wait and show the stages on the next slide. Do not run this live unless it has been rehearsed.

<p>The controller committed a sealed spec, then recorded the new tests failing first: 17 failing assertions, none passing.</p>

<!--
Step 3 of 4. These durations are the recorded start and finish times of each attempt, from the task state file. Product wrote the spec and the six behavior scenarios; Adversarial checked its citations and passed; the controller then sealed the spec in a commit and, during Implementation, recorded RED: the new tests fail before any implementation exists, with 17 relevant assertion failures, zero passing and no import errors. Implementation was then attempted twice and failed both times. Say plainly that this run did not reach Review, Drift or QA. The durations are for one tiny task and are not a benchmark.

# Walkthrough 4 ·<br>Read the result.

<div class="two"><section><h3>What held</h3><p>Spec and failing tests are sealed in commits.</p><p>Both failed attempts are retained.</p><p>Nothing was merged or pushed.</p></section><section><h3>Why it stopped</h3><p>Implementation needs a recorded independent review of the test classification.</p><p>Adversarial did not record one, and the worker would not forge it.</p></section></div>
<div class="takeaway">The gate held. It would not invent the missing review.</div>
<p>We did not establish why the review was not recorded.</p>

<!--
Step 4 of 4. Read the result, not the exit message. The implementation worker's finding says proof sealing was blocked with reason classification_unreviewed: every applicability review in the behavior scenarios was null and the passed Adversarial receipt carried no classification-review evidence. It said the attestation must come from an independent reviewer and be recorded by the controller, that the implement stage cannot supply or forge it, and that GREEN, the passing implementation, was therefore not written. That is the harness refusing to turn a missing check into a pass, the same principle as slide 44 and the previous allowance story. It is also a limitation: we do not know why Adversarial recorded no review for this tiny spec, and the Adversarial log shows an unrelated-looking sandbox warning, child setpgid operation not permitted, so the test environment may have contributed. Do not claim Nightshift completes arbitrary tasks.

<!--
Optional slide; skip it if the fix is not released. Tested 2026-11-12 with Claude Code 2.1.322: as shipped at v0.4.0 the plugin fails to load because .claude-plugin/plugin.json has repository as an object. With repository set to the URL string, validation passes, 23 nightshift: commands register, and /nightshift:nightshift-help runs. The full /nightshift:nightshift-eng pipeline was not run this way. Plugin commands are namespaced and the plugin is loaded for this session only. On the presenter laptop the unqualified /nightshift-eng and nightshift still point to the private checkout; use the namespaced command or the NS path.
